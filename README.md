# Node JS Intro

Welcome to my Node.js learning journey repository! This repository serves as a documentation of my exploration of Node.js and its various modules. Let's start with some basic concepts:

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and provides a platform for building fast, scalable network applications.

## Basic Modules in Node.js

### os Module

The `os` module provides a way of interacting with operating system-related utilities and information. It can be used to retrieve information about the system's hardware, operating system, and networking interfaces.

### fs Module

The `fs` module, short for File System, allows you to work with the file system on your computer. It provides methods for reading, writing, updating, and deleting files and directories.

### path Module

The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It helps in creating platform-independent file paths and resolving relative paths.

### uuid Module

The `uuid` module is used for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). UUIDs are 128-bit identifiers that are unique across both space and time, making them suitable for various purposes like generating unique keys or IDs.

### events Module

The `events` module enables you to create and handle custom events in Node.js. It provides an EventEmitter class that allows objects to emit and listen for events.

## Getting Started

To start learning and experimenting with Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Set up a new project directory for your Node.js projects.
3. Create a new JavaScript file and start writing your Node.js code.
4. Explore the documentation and examples for each module to deepen your understanding.

Happy coding!
